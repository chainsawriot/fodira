Die Omikron-Subvariante mit der Bezeichnung BA.2.75 wurde zunächst in Indien entdeckt. Nun hat man sie auch in Europa nachweisen können. <a href="https://www.gisaid.org" class="textlink--extern" title="Link zu: GisAid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Und auch in Ländern wie Kanada, Australien, Neuseeland und Großbritannien sind bereits Einzelfälle von BA.2.75 aufgetreten</a>. </p>

Die genauen Daten der Sequenzierungsergebnisse vom RKI würden zudem immer eine Verzögerung von rund vier Wochen aufweisen, sagt der Virologe Manuel Krone von der Uniklinik Würzburg. Der Molekularbiologe Ulrich Elling von der Österreichischen Akademie ist für die Sequenzierungs-Überwachung in ganz Österreich verantwortlich und hat in einem Twitter-Post auf die mögliche Gefahr durch BA.2.75 hingewiesen. </p>

In einem Interview mit dem <em>SWR</em> erklärt Elling, dass weltweit erst wenige BA.2.75-Fälle nachgewiesen sind. Bei den geringen Fallzahlen müsse man jedoch beachten, wie wenig Sequenzierungen es in den Ländern gibt. Daher seien&nbsp;kaum Daten über die neue Corona-Subvariante vorhanden. Elling beobachtet die Situation in Indien sehr genau. Dort wurde BA.2.75 bereits in mehreren Regionen nachgewiesen. Bisher gab es in <a href="https://covspectrum.org/explore/World/AllSamples/Past6M/variants?variantQuery=%5B6of%3A+S%3A147E%2C+S%3A152R%2C+S%3A157L%2C+S%3A210V%2C+S%3A257S%2C+S%3A339H%2C+S%3A446S%2C+S%3A460K%2C+ORF1a%3A1221L%2C+ORF1a%3A1640S%2C+ORF1a%3A4060S%5D&amp;" class="textlink--extern" title="Link zu: Fälle in Indien" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Indien 213 nachgewiesene Fälle</a>.

Es ist noch zu früh, die Bedrohung durch die neue Omikron-Variante BA.2.75 einzuschätzen. Richard Neher vom Biozentrum Basel betont die dünne Datenlage. Auch andere Expertinnen und Experten verweisen darauf, dass man über die Gefährlichkeit der Variante im Moment nur spekulieren könne. Bisher sei jedoch kein schwererer Krankheitsverlauf als bei BA.2 und BA.5 bekannt. </p>

BA.2.75 macht im Namen schon deutlich, dass es sich um eine BA2-Linie handelt und wahrscheinlich auch aus diesem Virustyp entstanden ist.

Die BA2-Variante habe sich noch um mehrere Mutationen erweitert, erklärt Ulrich Elling. Die Omikron-Untervariante BA.5 unterscheidet sich von BA.2 mit drei Mutationen auf dem Spike-Protein. Schon diese Diskrepanz reichte aus, dass sich die Variante rasch durchsetzen konnte. BA.2.75 hat elf neue Mutationen, acht davon am Spike-Protein. Diese Veränderungen könnten Reinfektionen erleichtern:&nbsp;"Die elf Mutationen, in denen sich BA.5 und BA.2.75 unterscheiden, könnten eine weitere Welle ermöglichen, da die Immunität von BA.2 und BA.5 möglicherweise nicht schützt", spekuliert der Molekularbiologe Ulrich Elling. </p>

Es gibt Vermutungen, dass die schnelle Verbreitung in Indien daran liegt, dass die Variante BA.2.75&nbsp;auch für bereits an BA.2 erkrankte Personen ansteckend ist. Elling erklärt: "In jedem Land hat sich inzwischen eine sozusagen landestypische Immunität gebildet." So zeigte sich in Südafrika eine sehr starke BA.1-Welle. Im südafrikanischen Kontext schaffte es die BA.5-Variante, den Immunschutz von BA.1 umgehen. Indien kämpfte dagegen mit der BA.2-Welle. Ob BA.2.75 den Schutz von BA.2 umgeht, wäre gerade in Deutschland auch relevant. Deutschland hat neben einer starken BA.1-Welle vor allem auch eine sehr starke BA.2-Welle erlebt.</p>

Modellrechnungen stützen die Annahme, dass sich die Sommerwelle nicht so einfach vertreiben lassen wird. Welche Rolle die Subvariante BA.2.75 spielen, und wie viel Einfluss sie nehmen könnte, ist schwer zu prognostizieren. Denn es muss nicht sein, dass sich eine der Subvarianten durchsetzt, möglich ist auch eine Koexistenz. Dieses Szenario hält der Molekularbiologe Elling für denkbar: "Es könnte auch dazu kommen, dass beide Varianten eine Koexistenz eingehen, also nebeneinander existieren." </p>

Das andere Ziel sei, die Verbreitung zu stoppen. Der Impfstoff, welcher ursprünglich auf das Wildtyp des Coronavirus angepasst war, hat erstmal alle dieser Impfziele erfüllt. Bei der Omikron-Linie ist die Impfung zwar weiterhin in der Lage, gut vor Tod, schweren Verläufen und Hospitalisierung zu schützten, jedoch nur eingeschränkt gegen Infektion, gegen Erkrankungen und gegen Weiterverbreitung.&nbsp;</p>
